Gwydion Dylan 2.3.1

  This is the first release of the new development branch. Lots of
  things changed: the build system has been completely revamped by
  Eric Kidd to support bootstrapping under various conditions, the
  instance? test has been made faster by Andreas Bogk, there's an
  OpenBSD port by Brad Dominy, work has been done (but not yet
  finished) on a Harlequin Dylan compatible c-ffi by Peter Housel,
  Eric Kidd started work on replacing melange by pidgin. There's now
  support for Common Dylan (which includes a file-system and an
  operating-system library by Tom Emerson), which should give source
  code compatibility with Harlequin; dig, a debugging frontend to gdb
  which understands Dylan now works on Posix systems, Jeff Dubrule has
  provided a mindy port to Linux on Alpha, Tom Emerson implemented
  Unicode escape in strings, and of course bugs have been fixed by
  various people.


Gwydion Dylan 2.2.0 

  This is basically a polished-up 2.1.3, with several more bugfixes.
  It is intended to be a stable release without too much new code
  introduced.

Gwydion Dylan 2.1.3 (1998-12-??)

  This release includes Melange enhancements by Peter Housel, Andreas Bogk
  and Eric Kidd; bug fixes by Andreas Bogk; optimizer fixes by Matthias
  Hoelzl; and a new parse-arguments library (and lots of documentation) by
  Eric Kidd.

Gwydion Dylan 2.1.2 (1998-12-01)

  A feature freeze is now in effect, and only a few critical bugs remain
  before 2.2. This release includes bug fixes by Andreas Bogk, Peter Housel
  and Eric Kidd; the new Dylan table-protocol by Peter Housel; build
  process cleanup by Andreas Bogk and Peter Housel; Cheap-IO enhancements
  by Eric Kidd; and more debugging support by Jeff Dubrule.

Gwydion Dylan 2.1.1 (1998-10-18)

  Dylan is an advanced programming language, similar to Java, but with many
  power-user features borrowed from Common LISP. Gwydion Dylan was written
  by the Gwydion Group at CMU and is now maintained by a group of
  volunteers. This is a beta of Gwydion Dylan 2.2, which will be intended
  to allow people to learn Dylan and write programs for their own personal
  use.  We will soon begin the 2.3 development cycle, with the goal of
  making Gwydion Dylan suitable for day-to-day development of production
  code.

  This release includes many bug fixes by Jeff Dubrule, Andreas Bogk, and
  Peter Housel; a tricky and impressive CSE fix by Matthias Hoelzl; more
  documentation work by Peter Housel and Eric Kidd; major Melange
  improvements by Eric Kidd; a 30% performance improvement to Mindy by
  Pierre de Pascale; more low-level C interface work by Peter Housel; and the
  beginnings of GDB support by Jeff Dubrule.

Gwydion Dylan 2.1 1998-09-16

  This month's snapshot includes a LinuxPPC port by Andreas Bogk, new
  Solaris binaries from Ole Tetlie, C-to-Dylan callback support by Peter
  Housel and a vastly improved Emacs dylan-mode courtesy of Harlequin, Ltd
  (and others). Peter Housel has also worked extensively on cleaning up and
  adding to the documentation.
 
Gwydion Dylan 2.1 1998-08-17

  The current release has been prepared by a group of volunteers. It
  includes improved FreeBSD support and a better build system. It can also
  parse most of the standard Linux C headers and automatically generate
  Dylan interfaces.
