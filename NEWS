Gwydion Dylan 2.1.1 (1998-10-18)

  Dylan is an advanced programming language, similar to Java, but with many
  power-user features borrowed from Common LISP. Gwydion Dylan was written
  by the Gwydion Group at CMU and is now maintained by a group of
  volunteers. This is a beta of Gwydion Dylan 2.2, which will be intended
  to allow people to learn Dylan and write programs for their own personal
  use.  We will soon begin the 2.3 development cycle, with the goal of
  making Gwydion Dylan suitable for day-to-day development of production
  code.

  This release includes many bug fixes by Jeff Dubrule, Andreas Bogk, and
  Peter Housel; a tricky and impressive CSE fix by Matthias Hoeltzl; more
  documentation work by Peter Housel and Eric Kidd; major Melange
  improvements by Eric Kidd; a 30% performance improvement to Mindy by
  Pierre Pascale; more low-level C interface work by Peter Housel; and the
  beginnings of GDB support by Jeff Dubrule.

  This month's snapshot includes a LinuxPPC port by Andreas Bogk, new
  Solaris binaries from Ole Tetlie, C-to-Dylan callback support by Peter
  Housel and a vastly improved Emacs dylan-mode courtesy of Harlequin, Ltd
  (and others). Peter Housel has also worked extensively on cleaning up and
  adding to the documentation.

  Dylan interfaces.
