Gwydion Dylan 2.1 Snapshot Release
==================================

THIS IS A SNAPSHOT RELEASE OF THE IN-DEVELOPMENT VERSION OF GWYDION
DYLAN. Expect some bugs and extremely rough edges.

Gwydion Dylan provides two implementations of the Dylan programming
language: Mindy and d2c. Mindy is bytecode compiler and interpreter, and
d2c is a Dylan-to-C compiler. Mindy compiles programs quickly, but the
resulting executables run slowly. On the other hand, d2c compiles programs
slowly, but they run quickly. Future development will mostly concentrate on
removing bugs from d2c, adding new features, and making it run faster. To
the best of our knowledge, nobody is actively maintaining Mindy at the
moment.

Gwydion Dylan was originally written by the Gwydion Group at CMU as part of
a research project studying advanced hypercode development environments. It
is now maintained by a group of volunteers.

To install Gwydion Dylan, take a look at the INSTALL file. For more

omissions and shortcomings are drastic. Use Gwydion only if you're feeling
daring and wish to experiment with a compiler currently under development.
