// The semantics of these constants are taken from the documentation for
// the operating-system library in Harlequin Dylan 1.2:
//
// http://www.harlequin.com/products/ads/dylan/doc12/io/io_222.htm
//
// The HQN documentation does not specify the types of $machine-name and
// $os-name, though HD 1.2 returns a <symbol> for each.
//
// Note that the value of $architecture-little-endian? is computed during
// configuration. It is not taken from the platforms.descr for the target
// architecture. This shouldn't be a problem, but it is worth documenting
// this possible cause of conflicting values.
//
