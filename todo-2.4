- implement limited() for collections other than vectors
- Clean up documentation
- make regression tests pass
- get rudimentary source debugging going again
- the #line directives need to be tidied up -- I suggest that 
           macro and inline function expansions should never generate #line 
	              directives
- get dybug useful again
- network library
- examples
- shootout examples
