// Module portability is a tiny OS dependent module which defines the
// preprocessor definions and "standard" include directories which would be
// used by a typical C compiler for that OS.  It may, at some future date,
// also include behavioral switches for things like slot allocation or sizes
// of different sorts of numbers.
//
// This particular implementation of module portability corresponds to the
// compilation environment for an Intel x86 running Linux 2.x.x.
