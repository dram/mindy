This is a development version of Pidgin, a tool for parsing C headers and
generating Dylan bindings. Many of the parts are designed to be reusable.

This version is intended for review and public comment.

Current status:

 * ANSI C library
   - C type model should be complete
   - C declaration should be complete

 * C parser
   - Not yet integrated from Melange

Please mail your feedback to <eric.kidd@pobox.com>. You can find more
information about pidgin in the comp.lang.dylan newsgroup and on the
Gwydion Dylan website at:

----- PROBLEM AREAS -----
c-parser.input needs to know about enum members for constant folding
c-lexer.dylan needs to know about typedefs (in a complicated fashion, too)
c-parser.input knows too much about function arguments
c-parser.input refers to '@0.objects' a lot
c-parser-interface.dylan uses 'state.objects' in 'declare-objects'.
