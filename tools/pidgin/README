This is a development version of Pidgin, a tool for parsing C headers and
generating Dylan bindings. Many of the parts are designed to be reusable.

This version is intended for review and public comment.

Current status:

 * ANSI C library
   - C type model is mostly complete
   - C declaration model is half done

 * C parser
   - Not yet integrated from Melange

Please mail your feedback to <eric.kidd@pobox.com>. You can find more
information about pidgin in the comp.lang.dylan newsgroup and on the
Gwydion Dylan website at:
