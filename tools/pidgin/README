This is a development version of Pidgin, a tool for parsing C headers and
generating Dylan bindings. Many of the parts are designed to be reusable.

This version is intended for review and public comment.

Current status:

 * ANSI C library
   - C type model should be complete
   - C declaration should be complete

 * C parser
   - Not yet integrated from Melange

Please mail your feedback to <eric.kidd@pobox.com>. You can find more
information about pidgin in the comp.lang.dylan newsgroup and on the
Gwydion Dylan website at:

----- THINGS TO DO -----
Here's a rough list of things to do before the C parser is integrated.

 * Reactive process-declarator, declare objects and add-declaration.
 * Get rid of declaration-closure.
 * Hook parse-c-file up to the parser engine.
 * Cut out dead code.
 * Replace code in c-parser-stubs.dylan with ANSI-C equivalents.
 * Handle all the problems described in "PROBLEM AREAS" below.

----- PROBLEM AREAS -----
This is an older list.

c-parser.input needs to know about enum members for constant folding
c-lexer.dylan needs to know about typedefs (in a complicated fashion, too)
c-parser.input knows too much about function arguments
c-parser.input refers to '@0.objects' a lot
c-parser-interface.dylan uses 'state.objects' in 'declare-objects'.

Also, look for code related to sizeof.
